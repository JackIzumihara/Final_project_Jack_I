    <h1>Welcome to my ICSpark Final Project Website!</h1>
    
    <p>
        Before you begin working on your final project, take the time to try and think of what you want your final project to be! 
        This website should be something you're proud of since you'll show it off to your friends and family at the end of the program!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This website can be whatever you want, as long as you can make it! Make sure that your idea isn't too big and difficult, but not too small and short either! 
        If you can't come up with a final website idea, here are a few ideas:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A Cookie Clicker Game</strong> â€“ Clicking on a picture increases your score, and you can make upgrades to increase your score further! It doesn't have to be a cookie, either! It can be whatever you want, it's your website!</li>
    </ul>
